A javascript application implementing a todo list using an observer pattern


##### Requirements

You are to implement a to-do list, with the ability to shift+click items to mark multiple as done (i.e. click item A, shift+click item C, item B is auto marked as done). At the top of this list there will be a realtime summary of how many items are marked as done and how many are left to go. At the bottom, there will be a 'Tweet this' button to post to Twitter the progress of items on the list (same as the summary at the top) as well as the last time a task was completed.

Bonus points if you can implement this using an observer pattern, which will require you to use OOP and write a rudimentary implementation of it.
